                <p>I was getting a bit frustrated wuth some of the commentary in the news papers
                    about simply giving lattes to buy houses. I created this page to show there's a
                    bit more to the housing problem and saving for a deposit than giving up a latte
                    a day can fix.</p>

                <p>This is a parody site and shouldn't be taken seriously, the stats are all
                    calculated in a basic way, by a shitty programmer and with crazy, wild
                    assumptions.</p>
