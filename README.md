# About

I was getting a bit frustrated with some of the commentary in the news papers
about simply giving up lattes to buy houses in some heated real estate markets
like Auckland, New Zealand.

I created this page to show there's a bit more to the housing problem and saving
for a deposit than giving up one latte a day can fix.

This is a parody site and shouldn't be taken seriously, the stats are all
calculated in a basic way, by a shitty programmer and with crazy, wild
assumptions.

I assume no interest growth in your savings. I don't include any inflation.

I assume 7% mortgage rates.

Billie Charlton did the Ux and design (which I haven't fully implemented yet!).
